=====================================================
Installing Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS with kernel 4.15.0-101
=====================================================


1. Download the .iso from this site:

    https://releases.ubuntu.com/bionic/

    The .iso will have a newer kernal (e.g., 5.3, which will have to be replaced later)

2. Write the .iso to a flash drive

- Insert a USB flash driver (> 4GB). Note that the contents of the drive will be overwritten
- Run Ubuntu's "Startup Disk Creator"
- Specify the location of the .iso and the target USB drive

3. Boot to the USB drive and install Ubuntu to the target SSD or HDD

4. Remove the USB drive and boot Ubuntu 18.04.4 from the target SSD or HDD

5. Install the older (4.15) kernel

    sudo apt install linux-generic

6. Boot to the newly installed 4.15 kernel

- Reboot the computer
- During the black screen, pres Esc. This will launch the GRUB menu.
- Select the 4.15 kernel and continue

7. Remove the unwanted kernels (e.g., 5.3.)

- Get list of all the kernels, except the currently active kernel:
    dpkg -l | tail -n +6 | grep -E 'linux-image-[0-9]+' | grep -Fv $(uname -r)

- For each unwanted kernel, use apt to remove it. May need to included the "unsigned"

    sudo apt remove --purge linux-image-5.3.0-28-generic linux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-28-generic
    sudo apt remove --purge linux-image-5.3.0-53-generic linux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-generic

8. Update grub

- Not sure this is necessary but likely won't hurt

    sudo update-grub2

9. Reboot
